A website made in Gatsby to utilize as a supplement to my job applications. Includes several custom react components as well as a few third-party components peppered in. Uses GraphQL queries as Gatsby's data layer for image and asset optimization. Several of my own illustrations decorate the landing page.

Check out `src/pages` as a good place to start!
